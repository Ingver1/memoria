"""Minimal runtime stub for ``numpy.random`` used by mypy.

This module only exists to satisfy type checkers that attempt to resolve
``numpy.random`` and nested modules such as ``numpy.random.mtrand``. It is not a
functional implementation â€“ tests use a lightweight stub under ``tests/_stubs``
when NumPy is not installed.
